# Data

This directory contains activity data from [COVID Moonshot](https://covid.postera.ai/covid/activity_data), a processing script to select relevant datapoints, and the screening library that is generated by running the code in the [`library_generation` directory](https://github.com/wjm41/mpro-rank-gen/tree/main/library_generation).

run `simple_processing.py` to process the activity data and split it into seperate data files for acrylamide, choloroacetamide, and noncovalent molecules.
